# Universal-Sink-Algorithm
See source.cpp for full description.

This code takes 7 input text files, and outputs whether or not a univeral sink exists in a given adjacency matrix.  The algorithm runs in time 2V + 2(V-1), which ends up being O(V) which is linear.

I wrote this up to test my pseudo code for this problem.
